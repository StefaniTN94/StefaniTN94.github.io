                        <h2>It's Really Hard to Give AI "Common Sense"</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        In humans, common sense is relatively easy to identify, albeit a bit difficult to define. Get in line at the end of it? That's common sense. Grab the red-hot end of a metal poker that was in the fire moments before? Not so much.

                        How do we teach something as nebulous as common sense to artificial intelligence (AI)? Many researchers have tried to do so and failed.

                        But that might soon change. Now, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen is joining their ranks.

                        Allen is investing an additional $125 million into his nonprofit computer lab, the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2), doubling its budget for the next three years, according to The New York Times. This influx of money will go toward existing projects as well as Project Alexandria, a new initiative focused on teaching "common sense" to robots.

                        "When I founded AI2, I wanted to expand the capabilities of artificial intelligence through high-impact research," said Allen in a press release. "Early in AI research, there was a great deal of focus on common sense, but that work stalled. AI still lacks what most 10-year-olds possess: ordinary common sense. We want to jump-start that research to achieve major breakthroughs in the field."
